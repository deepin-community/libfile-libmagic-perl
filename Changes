1.23     2020-08-28

- Fixed a bug with the Makefile.PL that caused every call to "make" to
  recompile the object file for the package's XS code. Reported by Kent
  Fredric. GH #28.


1.22     2020-04-26

- This is a stable release with the same changes as 1.21. See the change logs
  for 1.17 and 1.21 for details of what's new.


1.21     2020-04-04 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Add two class methods that provide introspection on the available limit
  processing parameters, max_param_constant() and
  limit_key_is_supported(). Based on a PR from Paul Wise. GH #24.


1.20     2020-03-28 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Fix one last test that assumed a limit parameter was available. Reported by
  Slaven Rezić. GH #22.


1.19     2020-03-28 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Fix tests that still mistakenly assumed that all limit parameter constants
  should be exported by File::LibMagic. Reported by Slaven Rezić. GH #22.


1.18     2020-03-28 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Not all versions of libmagic support setting processing limits, and those
  that do may not support all the limit parameters that the most recent
  version supports. This release fixes compilation and runtime issues that
  would occur with older libmagic versions that don't support the same options
  as the version I have installed locally. Reported by Slaven Rezić. GH #22.


1.17     2020-03-28 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Switched to using GitHub issues.

- Removed embedded copy of Config::AutoConf from distro. Instead this is now a
  configure phase prereq. Implemented by Paul Wise. GH #19.

- Moved list of constants in libmagic that we care about to one
  module. Implemented by Paul Wise. GH #20.

- Add support for setting libmagic processing limits. Implemented by Paul
  Wise. GH #15.

- Check all libmagic function return values properly and croak on
  failure. Implemented by Paul Wise. GH #21.


1.16     2017-10-22

- Added a doc note on installing the required dependencies on Red Hat. RT
  #110796.

- Fix tests on macOS. Based on PR #7 from Tom Wyant.


1.15     2015-09-19

- Fix the Makefile.PL so that we don't install the LibMagic.xs and typemap
  files. Based on a patch from Petr Pisar. RT #107081.


1.14     2015-09-16

- Fixed handling of extra include dirs passed to Makefile.PL via the -I
  flag. This wasn't working properly in previous releases. Reported by Andy
  Jack. GH #6.


1.13     2015-07-12

- Fix failing tests with some versions of libmagic. PR #5 by E. Choroba.


1.12     2015-03-07

- The constructor now accepts named params. In addition to a magic_file param,
  it now accepts follow_symlinks and uncompress params. These do what you'd
  expect, tell the object to follow symlinks and/or uncompress files when
  getting info from them. The old single parameter constructor is still
  supported, but is no longer documented.

- The old APIs are now called "discouraged" rather than "deprecated" in the
  documentation. I have no plan to remove these APIs any time soon or to make
  them warn, so "deprecated" was too strong a word.

- Changed a test to hopefully skip rather than fail on OpenBSD systems.


1.11     2015-03-01

- The info_from_handle() method did not handle binary data correctly, which
  could lead to incorrect results.

- The info_from_*() methods returned a full mime type with encoding in the
  "mime_type" key rather than just the mime type alone.

- Allow File::LibMagic->new() to accept an array reference containing multiple
  magic file paths.


1.10     2015-02-01

- Fixed Makefile.PL to actually use --lib and --include properly. Previously
  it did the wrong thing with both of these arguments, and they were
  essentially ignored. Reported by WATANABE Hiroaki. Patch by Mithun
  Ayachit. RT #101715.


1.09     2014-12-20

- No code changes. This release just removes some junk that accidentally ended
  up in the last release's tarball. Reported by Alexander Bluhm. RT #101015.


1.08     2014-12-17

- Fix generated Makefile.PL so it's compatible with older versions of
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker. The previous release accidentally required EUMM 6.83_04
  or newer without declaring this in configure_requires. Reported by Nick
  Peterson and solved by Slaven Rezic. RT #100975.


1.07     2014-12-14

- No changes from 1.06.

[SUMMARY OF USER-FACING CHANGES SINCE 1.03]

- Added yet another OO API to File::LibMagic. This provides a simpler and more
  future-proof API which can be expanded on later. The new methods are
  info_from_string(), info_from_filename(), and info_from_handle(). The latter
  method allows you to get info about an open filehandle. These new methods
  return the description, MIME type, and character encoding in one call. This
  addresses RT #54843 and partially addresses RT #99470.

- Fix compilation with a threaded Perl.


1.06     2014-12-13 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Guard against older versions of libmagic that don't provide magic_version().

- Fix compilation with a threaded Perl.


1.05     2014-12-13 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Added a test that outputs the return value of magic_version() to help me
  debug test failures.


1.04     2014-12-13 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Added yet another OO API to File::LibMagic. This provides a simpler and more
  future-proof API which can be expanded on later. The new methods are
  info_from_string(), info_from_filename(), and info_from_handle(). The latter
  method allows you to get info about an open filehandle. These new methods
  return the description, MIME type, and character encoding in one call. This
  addresses RT #54843 and partially addresses RT #99470.


1.03     2014-08-30

- The shipped Makefile.PL now accepts --lib and --include command line
  arguments so you can specify additional lib and include directories. This
  should make this package easier to build on BSD systems, among
  others. Reported by Alexander Bluhm. RT #97945.


1.02     2014-07-26

- Added instructions for installing libmagic.so and magic.h to the POD and
  INSTALL.md file. Requested by Gabor Szabo. RT #97391.

- Switched from using Devel::CheckLib to Config::AutoConf with the hope that
  the latter will work with more compilers. Requested by Jens Rehsack. RT
  #46543.

- Switched the primary git repo to github
  (https://github.com/autarch/File-LibMagic).


1.01     2014-05-04

- Fixed repository metadata. Reported by Jens Rehsack. RT #89200.

- A File::LibMagic object would not close one of the handles it might have
  opened, leading to leaks. Reported by Alexander Zaitsev. RT #93512.


1.00     2013-09-02

- Don't get all excited about this being 1.00. It's just what comes after
  0.99.

- The checktype_contents() and describe_contents() methods now accept a scalar
  ref in addition to a plain scalar. RT #28747.


0.99     2013-08-26

- More test changes to try to get tests passing on midnightbsd.


0.98     2013-08-25

- Fix test failures on midnightbsd (I hope) by relaxing a MIME type check in
  one of the tests.


0.97     2013-06-23

- Updated to the latest Devel::CheckLib, which should fix error reported by
  Perl 5.18 against the old CheckLib we were shipping. Reported by Dominic. RT
  #85210.

- We no longer link against libz, since this module doesn't need it. Reported
  by Ansgar Burchardt. RT #56479.

- Fixed tests to work with the latest libmagic. Patch by Gregor Herrmann. RT
  #75457.

- Attempted to make the tests work with various versions of libmagic. Please
  report failures and your file/libmagic package versions.

0.86     2008-05-18
      'file' version 4.24 returns slightly different filetypes.
      this makes 'make test' fail. fixed it for the new 
      version. But I'm afraid this breaks the 'make test' for
      older versions of the package 'file'.
